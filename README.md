# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.

Page has been updated to render client side web pages that dynamically update with the use of jquery. This was developed with a mobile first approach and with the use of media queries, it enabled the page to change depending on the viewport size. Some features that have been added include: scroll to top btn, hide/show new tweets section, and some validation handeling with character counts and error msgs.
